# Implementation status

Maintained per plan §20.1. A task is **done** only when its completion evidence exists and its checks pass.

**Current milestone:** M0 complete (Gate G0 passed, 10 October 2026). **Next task:** P1.1 Canonical schema package (hardening), then P1.2 Safe committed inventory.

## Phase 0: prove constraints and lock contracts

| Task | Status | Evidence | Checks |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0.1 Toolchain/skeleton | Done | 13 workspace packages matching plan §5.3; strict TS (`tsconfig.base.json`); exact pins in [toolchain.md](toolchain.md); [ADR-013](adr/ADR-013-pin-typescript-6-compiler-api.md), [ADR-014](adr/ADR-014-toolchain-and-library-pins.md); CI on Ubuntu and Windows (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) | `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:deps` (declared deps, source imports, runtime-instrumentation ban; negative case verified) |
| P0.2 TS resolver spike | Done | `packages/analyzer-ts`: syntax facts, require shadowing, virtual FS host, config discovery with bounded `extends`, workspace map, precedence rules 1–7. Decisions in [ADR-015](adr/ADR-015-resolver-context-policy.md) | `analyzer-ts/test/extract.test.ts` (9), `resolve.test.ts` (39 hand-written expectations) |
| P0.3 Safe Git/object spike | Done | `packages/ingest`: generated metadata dir, scrubbed environment, ref resolution without revision syntax, tree/blob/commit/diff readers, process-tree kill, GitHub URL admission, filtered acquisition, explicit blob broker. Results in [ADR-016](adr/ADR-016-safe-git-acquisition-spike-results.md) | `ingest/test/local-git.test.ts` (27: traps, worktrees, alternates, SHA-256, adversarial trees, timeouts); `github.test.ts` (39 offline + 2 live, run with `ATLAS_NETWORK_TESTS=1`) |
| P0.4 Instancing/layout spike | Done | `packages/layout`: square-shelf packer v1, heights, xorshift32 seeds. `apps/web` spike: one InstancedMesh per batch, ID picking, HTML fallback. Report in [benchmarks/phase0-render-spike.md](benchmarks/phase0-render-spike.md) | `layout/test/pack.test.ts` (hand-computed reference, 150 randomized trees, order independence, 20k plots ≈ 30 ms); `pnpm spike:render` |
| P0.5 Contracts/fixtures | Done | `packages/schema` runtime contracts and semantic validators; generated JSON Schema (`packages/schema/generated/`) and OpenAPI (`docs/api/openapi.json`); handcrafted artifact; Harbor demo repository (12 real commits) with independent expectations; [contracts docs](contracts/) | `schema/test` (34), `test-fixtures/test/handcrafted.test.ts` (23), `analyzer-core/test/first-session.test.ts` (6); `pnpm contracts:check` |

### Gate G0 assessment

| Fundamental question | Answer and evidence |
|---|---|
| Can source be read safely? | Yes. Committed objects only, via an ATLAS-owned Git dir. Armed hooks, filters, textconv, external diff, helpers, aliases and an `ext::` promisor remote never execute, and a control run proves the traps were live. Missing objects are reported, never fetched. |
| Can supported imports be classified correctly? | Yes, for the declared matrix: 39 resolver expectations plus the full Harbor demo match hand-written outcomes, including Node-vs-bundler differences and workspace/alias cases. Non-compiler inferences are labeled. |
| Can the supported size be rendered? | Yes, on the recorded device. 10k and 20k buildings render in 2 draw calls; p95 frame time 17.8 ms (vsync-bound); 271/271 picks correct; heap 22–29 MiB; WebGL-absent and context-loss fallbacks show HTML. |

Open items carried forward (none block G0):

- External egress, DNS and container caps for hosted acquisition: Phase 5, P5.3 (ADR-016 interim limits).
- Render budgets on the plan's reference device class, plus Firefox: P3.6/P6.2.
- Cross-checking generated JSON Schema with an independent validator: P1.1.

## Phase 1: reliable ingestion and structural artifacts

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| P1.1 Canonical schema package | Next | Builds on the Phase 0 schema: add the snapshot/occurrence hash re-derivation check, cumulative byte validation, an independent JSON Schema cross-check and cross-platform canonical hash tests in CI |
| P1.2 Safe committed inventory | Planned | Exclusions, roles, coverage reasons, symlink/submodule/LFS/encoding accounting on top of `listTree`/`readObjects` |
| P1.3 Package/config discovery | Planned | Promote `discoverWorkspace`/`discoverProjects` to graph package nodes and coverage warnings |
| P1.4 Artifact I/O | Planned | Deterministic gzip chunks, manifest hashing, atomic output, browser import validator |
| P1.5 Minimal CLI | Planned | `doctor`, `analyze`, `inspect`, `verify` per [contracts/cli.md](contracts/cli.md) |

## How to reproduce Phase 0 evidence

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm verify                                     # typecheck, dependency direction, contracts, tests
ATLAS_NETWORK_TESTS=1 pnpm exec vitest run packages/ingest/test/github.test.ts
pnpm spike:render                           # writes docs/benchmarks/phase0-render-spike.{md,json}
```
